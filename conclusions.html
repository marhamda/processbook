		  <p><u>StudySesh</u></p>
		 <p> The majority of the process, our design remained nameless. We waited the whole quarter for the name to just come to us.
		  While filming our video, we referred to our design as StudySesh. We then decided that that's what we would call it because
		  we created a program that is exactly that; a study session.</p>
		  <p>If given more time, I would like to build upon the 
			statistics page at the end of the session. I think this is one of the most important aspects of our design. It reveals 
		  to the user how much time he/she lost because of distractions. It would be beneficial to possible display the top sites/programs the user 
		  went to during his her break.</p> I am personally very happy with the outcome of our design. We conquered the problem of having too much information
		  surround us by building a wall that blocks all of that information.</p>
		  <p></p>
		  <p><u>Personal Reflection</u></p>
		  <p>A class about design requires a fair amount of ideation and creativity. On the first day of class I knew that I wanted to come up with a unique design to solve a typical problem that college students face. Although there is nothing wrong with a simple design if it works, I did not want my group to come up with the most obvious solution to our problem. Personally, my greatest difficulty in working on this project was stretching my creativity and expanding my ideas.
I had a hard time with this in various spots throughout the design process. The assignment to come up with 40 solutions was especially difficult for me. I was able to come up with around five ideas with ease, but upon doing research, they were all ideas that already existed. Coming up with 35 more ideas took me several hours and most were either very generic or weak. Through this process however, I pushed myself to think deeply about ways to solve the problem and allowed some ideas to build off of other ideas. This exercise did help me uncover ways to stretch my ideas even after I thought there were no more ways to do this. 
My group members and I split up each of the pages to design for our prototype. For my pages, I felt very limited in my ideas and creative skill to create something I would be happy with.  For example, one of my tasks was to create the “set time” option. There are many ways to go about this (number pads, user input), but I wanted to create the most efficient way that looked the best.  I also struggled when it came time to make revisions to my design. There were things I did not want to change because I did not know how to improve it in a way that I liked.
The thing that made my work much easier was the ability to collaborate with my group members. After struggling with my own ideas, having a team to come back to always reassured me and I felt relieved that that a unique idea was not entirely dependent upon me. It also made me feel refreshed because having three minds led to creative idea sharing and often inspired me on my own ideas. 
Initially, I had a feeling that I would struggle with a design because I had the idea that I lacked creativity. In this class however, we learned that no uncreative people exist. If I had the chance to redo this project, I would maintain that understanding throughout the project; that would have helped my confidence while making personal design choices and would have probably stretched my inventiveness even further. I think that one reason I struggled was because I had high expectations for something that I had little experience in. For the next time, I would make sure I enjoyed the design process more. If I was less tense about coming up with a unique design, I think a lot of the difficulties I faced would have been eliminated.
