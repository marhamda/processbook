		  <p><u>Initial Idea</u></p>
          <p>Team K’s decision to build a solution that eliminates the lack of focus many students tend to have was not the initial idea.
		</p>

		<p>
		On the first day our group met to discuss information problems, there was one problem in particular we all seemed to have; finding the ideal place to study on campus. The University of Washington has many libraries, study rooms and cafés all with different environments; the process of searching for the perfect spot that meets specific study needs can be an overwhelming process.
		</p>
		<p>
		We each interviewed two students about this problem. We asked how they go about finding a study spot and what kind of conditions are required for a successful study session. After comparing information with my group members, we discovered several shortcomings with this problem:
		</p>
		<ol>
			<li>This was not as big of an issue as we thought it was; some claimed to have no problem with finding a specific study spot.</li>
			<li>Several students found that libraries and cafes did not match their ideal study environment</li>
			<li>The study needs change based on what type of studying is being done, meaning an individual does not need just one study spot.</li>
			<li> SpaceScout is a program that students already use and provides a solution for our problem (such as a survey of study conditions, a map and pictures of each study location, current available space)</li>
		</ol>
		<p>At this point, we realized that finding the ideal study location was not the actual problem students were having.
			Thinking about it now, I think we decided on the problem based on a specific solution in mind. We were told not to think about solutions at this point, but we did anyways and this stole time from us.
			Using the information we had at this point, we took a step back. Finding the ideal study spot was meant to optimize focus and limit distractions; this led us to realize the main issue: <b> students have a hard time focusing on schoolwork because there are too many distractions.</b></p>
			Although I felt like it was too late to start over, my groupmates and I agreed that it would be worth the time to pursue this problem space.

<p><u> The New Problem </u></p>

<div class= "col-sm-6">
<p><center>With the new problem in mind, I conducted a few more interviews to gather more information about this problem:</center></p>
<table id="t" border="1">
<tr>
<td></td>
<td>What are your online  distractions?</td>
<td>What are your offline  distractions?</td>
<td>How do distractions effect your study sessions?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Preston Dang</td>
<td>Videos, articles, Vines, social media</td>
<td>Hungry, laziness, friends, clubs, class</td>
<td>Writes in spurts. Write one page, takes breaks work again. Breaks occur more often as time progresses</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Asmaa El-Ghazali</td>
<td>Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat</td>
<td>Loud music, people talking.</td>
<td>Spends about 1/4th of the time not working on HW. </td>
</tr>
</table>
</div>


<div class="col-sm-6">		
		<center>My group members and I also came up with a list of common distractions:</center>
		<center><img border="0" src="c.png" alt="list" width="404" height="328"></center>
	</div>

	<p>Through our interviews (including the first round) and our list of distractions, my group members and I decided to narrow the problem down even further and focus on <b>limiting distractions on the computer, online and offline</b>.
		We feel this is a major source for lack of focus because the majority of schoolwork requires the use of a computer which is a main portal to distractions. </p>
