          <h2><center>Discovering a Solution</center></h2>
		  <p>At this point we had clear understanding of who and what we are designing for,  as well as what type of features we wanted to incorporate in our solution. It came time to think about building our solution.</p>
		<p>In class, our group discussed various types of solutions. We sketched three prototypes that use different methods to solve the problem. We each performed two user tests for each of the prototypes to gather feedback on which will be the most successful.
		We asked the user to complete certain tasks during the tests to help us find identify the strengths and weaknesses of our prototype. </p>

	<p>This method creates a study session and punishes the user when he/she loses focus by trying to access some distracting program on the computer.
		We considered various punishments such as the computer shuts down or an annoying/unbearable video will play. We ended
		up implementing a complex code the user must enter by selecting it on the screen.</p>
		
<p><u>Interview Questions</u></p>
<ol>
<li>Select the programs you want to use. Firefox and sublime. What would you do next?</li>
<li>These are the sites that are blocked. You want to be able to watch videos, what would you do?</li>
<li>How long do you want to use this for?</li>
<li>Your session has begun, the k at the top leads to your toolbar. Say you want to take a break and check facebook, what would you do?</li>
<li>You want to proceed anyways, what would you do?</li>
<li>Use the code, read out what you would do.</li>
<li>How would you go back to your session?</li>

	<p><u>Results</u><p>
		I performed user tests with Lily Dwyer and Olga Kazakova. Both said the punishment system would be the most effective,
		but it was the system they both preferred the least. Our overall interview results reflected that people like creating a study
		session that <b>keeps track of the time they work</b>. They also liked the feature that keeps track of their <b>planned session time versus how long
		the session actually lasted</b> and <b>how many breaks they took and how long they lasted</b>. Even though it was not the most preferred system, almost everyone we interviewed claimed the punishment system would help them focus the most. Keeping the feedback in mind, 
		we decided to go with that system but tweak it in a way that felt less invasive and included elements from the other prototypes that people liked.</p>
